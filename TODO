4. It appears that we do support this feature but it was not documented.  An example: http://friendfeed.com/api/feed/user?emails=bgolub@benjamingolub.com
5. 
   1. http://beta.friendfeed.com/api/user/nickname/profile - now includes list information if you are currently authenticated as the profile you are requesting.
   2. http://beta.friendfeed.com/api/list/nickname/profile - request information about a list including the rooms and users in it.
   3. http://beta.friendfeed.com/api/feed/list/nickname - request a list feed.  Like other feeds this method supports filtering on service and paging with start/num arguments.

7. 
It hasn't been documented but you can use: http://friendfeed.com/NICKNAME/picture.  You can also specify the size: http://friendfeed.com/NICKNAME/picture?size=SIZE (where size can be "small", "medium", or "large")
8. 
You can now subscribe and unsubscribe from users and rooms via the
FriendFeed API.  The new API calls are:

Subscribe:
http://friendfeed.com/api/user/NICKNAME/subscribe
http://friendfeed.com/api/room/NICKNAME/subscribe

Unsubscribe:
http://friendfeed.com/api/user/NICKNAME/subscribe?unsubscribe=1
http://friendfeed.com/api/room/NICKNAME/subscribe?unsubscribe=1

These methods require an API key.  An API key is a private key that
developers can obtain by sending an email to api@friendfeed.com (this
is different from the via argument you are used to sending).
