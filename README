This code is kept online as a historical artifact. It may also be used
as a reference implementing the original FriendFeed API.

FriendFeed was a social feed aggregator.

The API provides calls to fetch different feeds, to publish data, to
comment and "like" entries and to get user profile information.

This pure-perl module uses LWP for HTTP fetching & JSON.pm for JSON parsing.
